## Projects

### Car crash severity classification (_2023_)
- Used a dataset with traffic data from ACT and one with traffic camera locations to predict the car crash severity under certain conditions. Applied different statistical models as well as a neural networks to the problem in order to compare their performance. Performed extensive data preprocessing as the dataset was very skewed. SVM ended up being the best model with an accuracy of 93%.
- Recieved the Berrijam Innovative Applications of AI Award for the project.
- Key technologies used: Sklearn, Numpy, Pandas.

### Language identification using convolutional neural networks (_2023_)
- Applied Convolutional Neural Networks to the Language Identification problem. Transformed audio samples to mel spectograms that was used as input for the model and subsequently trained it to identify five different languages. Performed hyperparameter tuning to identify optimal paramters for four different models. Best accuracy was 88.4% using a CNN-BiLSTM model.
- Key technologies used: Pytorch, Numpy.

### Data extraction from unstructured text (_2024_)
- The task was to extract data into a structured format from unstructured OCR texts. Tried 3 different experiments with mixed results. Initally tried applying an LLM to identify the desired data. It seemed to identify most of the relevant information, but it struggled with formatting. Then I attempted to use a rule-based approach. However, due to the erros in the text from the OCR and the variability in the data the results were insufficient. Therefore, I returned to the LLM approach, but now using LangChains JsonOutputParser which was able to structure the data on the desired format.
- Key technologies used: Ollama, LangChain.

### CSV -> pandas, web application (_2024_)
- A web application that processes and displays data. Input a .csv file and it returns the data as a df with the correct dtypes. You can also manually select other dtypes if needed. Uses React.js for the frontend and a Django for the backend API's.
- Key technologies used: Pandas, Django, React.
